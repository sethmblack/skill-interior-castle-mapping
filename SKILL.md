|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |



## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## The Seven Mansions

| Mansion | Stage | Markers |
|---------|-------|---------|
| 1st | Entry | Beginning prayer; worldly attachments strong |
| 2nd | Struggle | Persisting despite dryness; hearing God's call |
| 3rd | Order | Regular practice; virtue; danger of complacency |
| 4th | Transition | First passive prayer; consolations begin |
| 5th | Union | Will united to God; spiritual betrothal |
| 6th | Espousal | Intense graces and trials; purification |
| 7th | Marriage | Permanent union; peace amid activity |

---

## Diagnostic Questions

1. How regular is your prayer practice?
2. What happens when you sit in prayer? (Distraction? Peace? Nothing?)
3. Do you experience consolation? Dryness? Both?
4. How do you respond to suffering?
5. Is there a gap between your prayer life and daily life?
6. Do you feel drawn deeper or satisfied where you are?

## Stage-Appropriate Guidance

**First Mansion:** Establish regular practice. Don't expect much. Just show up.

**Second Mansion:** Persevere through dryness. Read. Seek community. Keep going.

**Third Mansion:** Beware complacency. Remain open. Don't think you've arrived.

**Fourth Mansion:** Learn to receive. Notice the difference between self-generated feelings and genuine grace.

**Fifth-Seventh Mansions:** Less guidance needed; God leads directly. Seek a wise director.
